            The roots of tennis can be traced back to ancient civilizations. It is believed that a game similar to tennis was played as far back as 1000 years ago. In ancient Egypt, there are depictions of a game called "stick and ball" where players used their hands to hit a ball made of papyrus or leather over a net.
        <br> <br>

        The modern form of tennis, often referred to as "real tennis" or "court tennis," emerged in France during the 12th century. Initially, it was played indoors in grand courtyards and was enjoyed by nobility. Real tennis featured a more complex court and a scoring system that was vastly different from the tennis we know today.

        The game quickly gained popularity throughout Europe, with England becoming a notable hub for its development during the 16th century. Henry VIII of England was an avid real tennis player and even had a court built at Hampton Court Palace.
        <br><br>

        While real tennis was flourishing in Europe, a new version of the sport was emerging in England during the late 19th century. This new version, known as lawn tennis, was played outdoors on grass courts and was accessible to a wider range of players. Major Walter Clopton Wingfield is often credited with inventing the first version of lawn tennis in 1873, and he patented it as "Sphairistike."

        Lawn tennis quickly gained popularity, and the All England Croquet Club (now known as the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club) held the first Wimbledon Championship in 1877. The event became one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world and played a pivotal role in the sport's global expansion.
        <br><br>

        As lawn tennis gained prominence, the rules and equipment continued to evolve. The introduction of lawn tennis rackets, with strings made of gut, marked a significant departure from the wooden paddles used in real tennis. The development of tennis balls also underwent various changes, with the switch from hand-stitched leather balls to rubber-based balls that could be mass-produced.

        The establishment of the International Lawn Tennis Federation (now known as the International Tennis Federation) in 1913 helped standardize the rules and regulations of the game. This governing body played a crucial role in unifying tennis across the globe and organizing international competitions.
        <br><br>
        Tennis entered the modern era with the rise of iconic players like Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, John McEnroe, and, later, the "Big Three" in men's tennis, consisting of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. These players have captivated audiences worldwide and helped elevate tennis to new heights of popularity.

        The sport has also become more inclusive, with the emergence of players from diverse backgrounds and the promotion of women's tennis as an equally prestigious discipline.
