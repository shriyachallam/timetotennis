        <p>
            There is a common saying: work smart, not hard. And although tennis requires a lot of hard work, there are many strategies and simple practices you can use to instantly improve your game. Playing for results is a skill completely different from just playing tennis. Practicing regularly to minimize your weaknesses and advance your strengths is important to obtain better results. Exercising off the court will improve your strength, footwork, technique, and stamina which are all key aspects of tennis required to better yourself as a player. However, once you are in the match, your opponent on the opposite side of the court, it's game on. Your mindset should shift from "How can I improve?" to "How can I win?" These are very different questions to be asking. Instead of practicing and hitting shots to improve your weaknesses, you want to keep your weaknesses hidden. Instead of focusing purely on yourself, you want to identify your opponent's strengths and weaknesses. All this can take a huge mental toll on a player, and this requires a lot of determination. Without determination, you won't consistently push yourself to work hard.
            <br>
            <br>Stretching and exercising will help to build strength and, therefore, hit harder and faster shots. This will also strengthen your endurance and stamina which are crucial during long tennis matches Stretching before and after playing tennis/exercising is a great habit to make. Stretching will keep your body flexibility - trust us, your body will thank you when you're older! Additionally, many people fail to regularly stretch causing easily avoidable injurie. Stretching exercises like reaching for your toes, crossing your arms, and many more... Stretching your back, arms, hamstrings, neck, and ankle are very important. Exercises like push-ups, running, lunges, pull-ups, and jump roping are some helpful exercises to build strength and stamina. 
            <br>
            <br>Playing to win during a tournament means using strategy and technique. No matter how well you play or how hard you try, your opponent may always be of higher skill. However, remember if you can control the game mentally, you still have a very good chance of winning. Now, there two ways to make your opponent lose: to target your opponent's weakness and avoid their strengths or to make your opponent run. Usually both strategies are needed, but, as rule of thumb, after the first 2 games, you should be able to identify your opponent's weaknesses and strengths. Keep in mind your own strengths and weakness and use those to guide how you will play. 
            <br>
            <br>During try outs season or during a tournament, try not to let your nerves get ahold of you. This is hard. Try to play with the same confidence as during practice. It's even better if you can turn your nerves into focus and determination. And remember, practice makes perfect. The more tournaments and nervous situations you put yourself in, the better you will get at managing your tension. Another thing to keep in mind is to stay hydrated! It is very easy to get lost in the game and forget to drink water or eat a snack, but these are very important to maintain your energy level throughout the game. Tennis is long, and you need enough nutrients to sustain yourself. 
            <br>
            <br>Always remember: every point matters. Tie breakers, set points, first points, and even during warming up. The saying that winners stay winning and losers stay losing is very true. But not for the reasons you may think. This saying is referring to the mindset of winning and losing. Even if you lose a point, game, or match, don't be discouraged. Instead, use your loss to motivate yourself to work harder and practice more. Don't have the mindset, "Oh its only one point I lost…" That mindset will not get you anywhere and for each point, you should have the mindset where you believe in yourself and work towards winning. Before every point, take time to think how you could have played better, regardless of if you won or lost the previous point. This will help you improve whenever you play and will give better results instantly. You need to spend as much time off court thinking and analyzing how you can get better and why other players are better as you spend on the court.
            <br>
            <br>Another important aspect of losing is not letting your anger or disappointment control your attitude. Instead of getting frustrated and sabotaging the rest of the match, take step back. It is always useful before and after each point to take a few deep breaths, think about what just happened, decide what went wrong and what went well, and move on. Don't let your anger control your actions. From personal experiences, many people play a lot worse when they are losing just because of their mindset. Good luck!
