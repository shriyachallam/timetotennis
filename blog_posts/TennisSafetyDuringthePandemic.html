        <div class="date">MAY 30, 2020</div> <!-- DATE-->
        <p>
            Hey there! We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting different parts of the country differently - in some states, it may be possible to return to playing tennis safely, especially with court facilities slowly opening up. By following the guidelines released by the federal government, as well as specific rules of local governments and health agencies, facilities and players can make informed decisions as to whether their tennis activities can resume. If you are in an area where it is safe to be playing tennis, tennis can be a great way for you to relieve stress, socialize with others, and exercise your body. Of course, our primary importance is taking every precaution to help keep all players safe.  
            <br>
            <br>Because tennis does not require any direct physical contact, you can enjoy the many physical and mental benefits that tennis offers as long as you are keeping six feet apart from other players. 
            <br>
            <br>BEFORE YOU PLAY
            <br>- Make sure your state or area has declared it safe to be playing tennis.
            <br>- Remember, safety precautions must remain in place until there is a universal vaccine or effective treatment for the coronavirus.
            <br>- Arrange to play mainly with family members or others who live in your household, if possible.
            <br>- Do not play if any of you are exhibiting any symptoms of the coronavirus (mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, difficulty breathing, or other symptoms identified by the CDC), have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days, or identify as a vulnerable individual and your state and region is in Phase One or Phase Two.
            <br>
            <br>PREPARING TO PLAY
            <br>- Wash your hands with a disinfectant and water (for 20 seconds or longer) or use a hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available before going to the court.
            <br>- Clean and wipe down all of your equipment.
            <br>- Do not share any equipment with others.
            <br>- Use new balls and a new grip, if possible.
            <br>- Consider taking extra precautions such as wearing gloves.
            <br>- Avoid touching court gates, fences, benches, etc.
            <br>
            <br>WHEN PLAYING
            <br>- Stay at least six feet apart from other players - do not make physical contact with them.
            <br>- Consider not playing doubles - this could lead to incidental contact and unwanted proximity.
            <br>- Avoid touching your face after handling a ball, racquet or other equipment. Wash your hands promptly if you have touched your eyes, nose or mouth.
            <br>- Stay on your side of court. Avoid changing ends of the court.
            <br>- Remain apart from other players when taking a break.
            <br>- If a ball from another court comes to you, send it back with a kick or with your racquet.
            <br>
            <br>Although unlikely, it’s possible that a tennis ball can transmit the COVID-19 virus, so take extra precautions when touching tennis balls:
            <br>- Open two cans of tennis balls that do not share the same number on the ball.
            <br>- Take one set of numbered balls, and have your opponent take the other set of balls.
            <br>- Proceed with play, making sure to pick up your set of numbered balls only. Should a ball with the other number wind up on your side of the court, use your racquet or feet to push the ball to your opponent.
            <br>
            <br>AFTER PLAYING
            <br>- Leave the court as soon as reasonably possible.
            <br>- Wash your hands thoroughly or use a hand sanitizer after coming off the court.
            <br>- Do not use the locker room or changing area. Shower at home.
            <br>
            <br>Thank you for reading! We hope everyone is staying safe and, if allowed, enjoying playing tennis.
