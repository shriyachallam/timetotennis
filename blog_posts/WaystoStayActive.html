        <div class="date">APRIL 10, 2020</div> <!-- DATE-->
        <p>
            In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to share some ways you can stay active while staying at home. It is important to maintain your fitness during these trying times. Not only will you be improving your tennis skills, but staying active can also preserve your mental state, allowing your quarantine to be happier and more productive! 
            <br>
            <br>Stretching and exercising will help to build strength and, therefore, hit harder and faster shots. This will also strengthen your endurance and stamina which are crucial during long tennis matches Stretching before and after playing tennis/exercising is a great habit to make. Stretching will keep your body flexibility - trust us, your body will thank you when you're older! Additionally, many people fail to regularly stretch causing easily avoidable injurie. Stretching exercises like reaching for your toes, crossing your arms, and many more... Stretching your back, arms, hamstrings, neck, and ankle are very important. Exercises like push-ups, running, lunges, pull-ups, and jump roping are some helpful exercises to build strength and stamina. 
            <br>
            <br>Additionally, the toss is a very important aspect of the serve. Many people argue that the serve is one the most important shots in the game, as it is the only shot a player can truly control. All you need for this exercise is your tennis racket, a tennis ball, and some free space. First, stand as if you are about to serve. Make sure to keep your front foot at a 45 degree angle. Next, place your tennis racket on the ground, alongside your foot, right in front of you. Now, toss the tennis ball into the air as if you were about to hit a serve and let it fall onto the ground. Observe where it falls. If it fell on the middle of your tennis racket, then great! But if it didn't, try again! Keep practicing your toss so that it lands on the strings of the racket. Try to keep you're the ball a medium height, a few feet above your head and a foot in-front of you. Keep practicing this until you can consistently land the ball toss on the racket.
            <br>
            <br>Next: pick a partner and practice your volleys! This exercise helps your reflexes. Everyone knows quick reflexes are necessary when you are up at the net and need to get those passing shots. So, just like how you would hit volleys back and forth on the court, do it outside with your partner. Make sure you have the correct grip and stance. Try to see how many volleys you can get in a row. If you don't have a partner, you can also use a flat wall. If you are using a wall, try to consistently hit the ball at a certain point. This will not only improves your reflexes, but also your aim, consistency, and technique. 
            <br>
            <br>This final exercise is simple. It helps build the correct swing and technique for each type of shot. All you need is a tennis racket and some free space. Practice every type of swing, volley, serve, backhand, forehand, overhead, etc. Make sure you keep your eyes on the imaginary ball, have the correct grip and form, and are swinging with force.
            <br>
            <br>Thanks for reading! We hope you enjoyed this article and learned some useful information on staying active and improving your tennis skills from home. We hope to see you soon!
