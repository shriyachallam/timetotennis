        <p>
            In response to the pandemic, the girls high school tennis season was cancelled. We interviewed a few of the members to hear how they are affected and how they are coping with the situation.            <br>
            <br>Q: How do you feel about the tennis season being cancelled?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: I’m really upset since tennis was kind of a source of relaxation after a stressful day of school. It would have been fun to hit with friends
            <br>Student 2: I'm sad that I won’t have the same fun experiences that are involved in tennis season such as team bonding and going to state.
            <br>Student 3:  I’m super bummed especially because the team spirit during the season is always a mood lifter but I’m glad everyone is staying safe and healthy at this time.
            <br>
            <br>Q: How does Covid-19 affect your physical and mental health?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: I haven’t really been playing tennis because of this because courts are inaccessible unless you want to play outdoors, but if anything I’ve been exercising since I have the time to do so.
            <br>Student 2: I feel less motivated to accomplish things but I'm still dedicating a lot of time to exercising.
            <br>Student 3: It’s been harder to get daily exercises in but overall with less pressure from school it’s kind of been a nice break.
            <br>
            <br>Q: How are you engaging in tennis activities due to the situation?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: I haven't been engaging too much but I have been playing with family which has been fun.
            <br>Student 2: Working on tennis specific exercises like running for endurance and reflex volleys.
            <br>Student 3: Watching tennis videos and doing mini workout routines at home
            <br>
            <br>Q: What do recommend for people who would start to play or continue to play tennis currently?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: Please make sure you stay outdoors and safe and away from other people at least for time being.
            <br>Student 2: You can build certain skills at home such as speed and reflexes with variations of ball tossing drills that are easy to do at home.
            <br>Student 3: Trying hard eye coordination drills even just with a ball is always a nice start.
            <br>
            <br>Q: When, how, and why did you start playing tennis?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: I think I started playing tennis around 5th grade, it was kind of just a summer sport for me and was a way to engage with my family as friends.
            <br>Student 2: I started playing tennis around the age of 7 because my parents introduced me to the sport and i began to play with them at parks.
            <br>Student 3: I started around 10 and just automatically fell in love on the mini courts and continued on. 
            <br>
            <br>Q: What are some tips for beginner tennis players?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: Have fun! Try to focus on hitting the ball because tennis requires a lot for focus and strength to hit the ball over the net compared to badminton which is relatively lightweight.
            <br>Student 2: For beginner tennis players, I would recommend starting with a good foundation by making sure your technique is correct and working on perfecting that first.
            <br>Student 3:  I'd recommend making sure you get technique down because incorrect technique is the hardest to change (endurance and other skills can come later).
            <br>
            <br>Q: From your experiences, what are some regrets you feel should be addressed to people who first begin to play tennis?
            <br>
            <br>Student 1: At least for me, tennis was much more enjoyable when it was less about competition and more about enjoying the sport so don’t focus too much on winning because you’ll eventually get there!
            <br>Student 2: Play lots of tournaments from a young age so you can grow and learn to be a better player in the future.
            <br>Student 3: None! It never hurts to try something new and tennis has definitely changed my life for the better.
            <br>
            <br> Thanks for reading and we hope to see you soon!
