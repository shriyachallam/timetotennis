        <div class="articletitle">An interview with our local tennis center</div>  	<!--TITLE-->
        <div class="date">MAY 6, 2020</div> <!-- DATE-->
        <p>
            In response to the pandemic, the girls high school tennis season was cancelled. We interviewed a few of the members to hear how they are affected and how they are coping with the situation.            <br>
            <br>Q: How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected your career and Robinswood Tennis Center?
            <br>
            <br>A: Once our facility shut down I have been working remotely and conducting/participating in conference calls through SKYPE, ZOOM, etc. From the administrative side the situation has allowed me to really learn to utilize all the wonderful technology tools that are available to us, which has been a positive. As a teaching professional, the negative is missing out on the personal interaction at the facility from our staff and customers, and program participants on the tennis court.
            <br>
            <br>Q: How does Covid-19 affect your physical and mental health?
            <br>
            <br>A: Well, each individual’s situation is different, we’ve all been impacted. It’s challenging being in isolation, I’m lucky I’m with my family but I’m in continual communication with outside family members, friends, co-workers. We’re all going through this together, it’s important we stay positive and re-assure each other, keep looking forward - this will pass. As far as physical activity it’s important to maintain some type of activity to stay balanced. Take advantage of the extra time we have - perhaps in your routine you take a daily walk around the neighborhood, work in the garden, or create a consistent at-home exercise regimen.
            <br>
            <br>Q: How are you engaging in tennis activities due to the situation?
            <br>
            <br>A: Since I don’t have access to tennis courts in my neighborhood I have a routine of exercises and conditioning so it will be an easier transition - so I won’t be so out of shape once I get back on the court.
            <br>
            <br>Q: What do recommend for kids who want to start playing or continue playing tennis during this time?
            <br>
            <br>A: I would recommend going to the USTA website. The USTA has been collaborating with partners in the tennis community to provide outstanding resources – for example USTA Net Generation shares specific “tennis at home”  tips, fun activities, videos, and educational content to keep tennis players engaged during the pandemic.
            <br>
            <br>Q:How can we support local tennis organizations?
            <br>
            <br>A: I think it’s important for tennis players to stay in touch with their local tennis clubs/organizations, share input – let us know your questions or concerns. As a community, tennis has been very proactive in working collectively in sharing information during the pandemic and preparing for getting back onto the courts once facilities re-open.
            <br>
            <br>Q: How do you think the pandemic will affect the tennis community for the future (your prediction)? 
            <br>
            <br>A: Well that’s the big question. The advantage in tennis is that there is already a certain amount of social distancing built into play. Tennis courts encompass a large playing area, and there is a net that divides the court in half and separates players. The game of tennis (basic rules) itself won’t change but some of the match procedures may change, perhaps players will no longer shake hands after matches, will no longer change ends, or will only use their own can of balls when serving. I don’t think passionate and dedicated tennis players will be as reluctant to return to play versus other sports such as wrestling. Those of us that work in the tennis industry are preparing our facilities (especially indoor facilities) to meet recommended guidelines to create a safe environment for our staff and customers. New procedural changes such as checking-in and out, assuring adequate cleaning/sanitizing of facility, adjusting capacity to allow appropriate social distancing, etc. This will be the new normal for us and I anticipate we will continue to adapt and change since this is such a unique situation.
            <br>
            <br>A special thank you to Mr. John Soriano, the head of the Robinswood Tennis Center, for answering these interview questions and supporting our organization.
