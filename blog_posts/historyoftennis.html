        <p>
            The game of tennis dates back centuries and has continued to evolve throughout the years. All this rich history that has surrounded tennis, has created all the customs and traditions that players recognize to this day. 
            <br>
            <br>The origin of tennis can be traced back to the 12th/13th in France where it was a sort of handball game called “jeu de paume”. This was then transformed into an indoor racket-and-ball game, similar to the modern-day real tennis. “Real tennis” is what it is called in Britain, “court tennis” in the United States, and “royal tennis” in Australia.  
            <br>
            <br>This game is now played by millions in every corner of the world. The game quickly grew popularity which created major championships for professionals and amateurs, alike, starting in the late 1960s. The first winner of the Wimbledon Championships was Spencer Gore where twenty-two entries were entered. This led to the rise of many notable players, as well as iconic rivalries. Some dominating players included the start by the Renshaw twin brothers and Dorothea Douglass as the first leading female player. She was a powerful figure also because she changed the way she dressed, no matter how controversial it was. Furthermore, some of the original rulebooks originated in 1875, which was a little after the game was introduced to the United States.  
            <br>
            <br>Not only did the game’s rules and regulations change, the equipment did as well. Tennis rackets had frames that were originally made of laminated wood and then started getting manufactured with metal. The tennis ball itself used to be leather, then they were transformed into wool, and then vulcanized rubber, and finally the pressurized tennis balls which are used in the modern world. An interesting fact about tennis balls is that there are more than 300 million tennis balls being produced globally every year. Since tennis used to be called “lawn tennis”, it was originally played only on grass fields. But then more surfaces were introduced such as cement, artificial grass, and other asphalt/synthetic surfaces.  
            <br>
            <br>The game continues to adapt when necessary, and they create the deep history of tennis that makes the game how special it is for a reason.
