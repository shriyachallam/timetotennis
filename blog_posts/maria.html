        <div class="date">July 24, 2021</div> <!-- DATE-->
        <p>
           Maria Sharapova is an iconic former women's tennis player that has been a monumental figure in the Women's Tennis Association. However, others may know Sharapova as the founder and starter of Sugarpova, her candy company. Sharapova founded this company in 2012 during a period of turmoil in Sharapova’s life. She had a career-threatening shoulder injury that made her reconsider the direction of her life after the realisation that her tennis career isn't always guaranteed. 
           <br><br>
           
            This Russian sensation always had an interest in business but never had the actual opportunity to pursue it. Further, she had always been the face of big brands before, but this time she wanted to be her own boss. With Sharapova’s big passion for candy and sweets from a young age, she took her love for sweets and athletics and combined them for the purpose of athletes and people overall learning to treat themselves. Now, Sugarpova is retailed all around the world today. 
           <br><br>
           
            Growing up in Russia, and turning pro at age fourteen, Sharapova’s life primarily revolved around tennis. School was not much of a priority. After coming to the United States with her dad and having only about $700 in her bank account in 1994, she was offered a spot at IMG academy in Florida where her tuition was paid for. At IMG, she learned to balance tennis and school. Sharapova did not attend college which she easily could’ve if she wanted to for tennis, however she didn’t because she wanted to focus solely on her career. IMG was her only type of educational background until 2016, where she then took two college courses focused on business to enhance Sugarpova. Sharapova enrolled in a global management course and leadership course at Harvard University all while being banned from the Women's Tennis Association for 15 months due to testing positive in a drug test at one of her grand slams. This gave her the opportunity to educate herself more on growing Sugarpova. Despite the fact that Sharapova doesn’t have a strong educational background, Sharapova argues that she learned the most about the business world from listening and talking with other entrepreneurs' about their stories and past experiences which she finds to be the most valuable source to learn from.
           <br><br>
           
           Sugarpova is simply a candy line that consists of delicious chocolates, gummies, truffles and gumballs all known to be all organic with non-gmo ingredients. It is known for its vibrant and colorful packaging, appearance and flavors. Each candy is somehow connected to Sharapova, whether that be the tennis gumballs that recognize her tennis career or the flirty candies which are correlated with her girly and feminine personality. The goal of this flamboyant candy line was to encourage athletes and people in general the idea of indulgence and satisfaction. Moreover, Sharapova slogans this company as “guilt free candy”. 
           <br><br>
           
           Sugarpova ultimately believes that all people that work hard should treat themselves because candy represents a sense of accomplishment no matter how big or small your achievements are.
           
           <br><br>
            More specifically, the chocolate is packed with antioxidants and the gummies and truffles are all made with real fruit, vegetable extract and no artificial flavoring. To keep customers engaged, Sugarpova has a candy mascot for their brand named Smooch, that is a big bold red lip that is also the shape of their logo. Smooch encourages Sugarpova customers to follow their social media and brand. With Smooch, Sugarpova wants customers to feel motivated to reward and treat yourself. Sugarpova’s target market is targeted towards candy lovers of all ages in general. More specifically, the branding for Sugarpova is more appealing to women in the range of 17-30 years old due to its colorful outlook and positivity behind their brand. Women who buy Sugarpova would typically be described as spunky, extroverted and optimistic. Sharapova felt that this would primarily be her market because she is all about girl power and celebrating strength. However, a lot of Sugarpova customers have been Sharapova’s fans which is a pretty equal ratio between male and females. With the help of her large following, the majority of the Sugarpova market has been noticed by tennis players of all levels and ages, due to the fact that she is one of the most well-known tennis players in the world. 
            
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Sugarpova also has had a big focus on athletes because Sugarpova wants to spread the message of rewardance. To do so, Sugarpova is commonly retailed at almost any grand slam or national tennis tournament for viewers to snack on, which is an essential part of how Sugarpova expands their market beyond just candy lovers.
            <br><br>
            At age 25 when Sharapova encountered a shoulder injury that jeopardized her career, Sharapova knew she had to think about her future beyond her tennis career. She has always seeked an opportunity to start her dream company Sugarpova, which is something she had made up in her head over the past years. With all the time off she was given, she made her dreams a reality by starting off with the knowledge she had gained with partnering with big brands in the past like Nike, Head, Evian and Samsung. 
            <br><br>
            At first, Sharapova was thinking of doing a fashion line because she thought Sugarpova may not attract people to the brand because she is an athlete and sugar and athletics dont usually correlate. However, she was so passionate about Sugarpova because sweets have been a huge part of her life growing up, and it was something she always liked to reward herself with after days of tough practices. More passionate than ever to share her project with the world, she recognized that gummy candy in the market is lacking strong brand recognition. Further, she felt that candy was only mainly catered towards children and not adults, and that's how she decided she would create a luxurious candy line catered more for adults. 
            <br><br>
            To start Sugarpova, Sharapova funded the whole thing from her fortune she had from tennis. After she came up with the goals of Sugarpova, the candies, and what she overall wants Sugarpova to be, she went to Red Antler branding agency to help make Sugarpova come to life. CEO of Red Antler JB Osborne, helped Sharapova develop Sugarpova’s brand identity. Osborne and Sharapova were a power duo and crafted the entire Sugarpova brand. After 18 months of making important decisions and many phone calls inbetween physical therapy and workouts in 2013, Osborne and Sharapova were happy to put Sugarpova in stores all over the world and at grand slams.  With Sharapova’s enormous following, people became obsessed with the brand and the energy of Sugarpova, and within a couple weeks all stock of the infamous tennis gumballs were sold out. Safe to say, Sugarpova was thriving.
