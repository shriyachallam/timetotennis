So far, I have played on JV 2 as third singles and (sometimes) 2nd doubles on Neuqua's tennis team. Other than tennis, I play the bassoon in the Neuqua Valley Band. I also read many classical novels in my free time. I'm proud to be a coach for this organization and aid many children into developing a passion for tennis!

                        <p>Hi! My name is Tanvi Bagal and I am a rising senior at Northside College Prep in Chicago, Illinois. I have been playing tennis for six years and have found a community filled with some of the most dedicated, kind people I have ever met. I have been on the Girl’s Varsity Tennis Team for all four years of highschool and have been the team captain for two years. I am working on TimeToTennis to create space for more people of various economic backgrounds within the community that I have grown up in. In my free time, I really enjoy reading and taking walks to explore the city.</p>

                        <p>Hello! My name is Maya Raman. I’m going to be a freshman at Neuqua Valley High School, and am super excited to be a part of the Illinois branch of Time to Tennis. I’ve been playing tennis for about 7 years, and it is a passion I hold dear to my heart. It has been something I could call mine, and my love to share this passion with others is what drove me to join the organization.</p>
