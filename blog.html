        <p>The majority of how you spend your time in any sport is the training portion, followed by practice matches, then competitions. Both tennis and table tennis have that as their important commonality. They both are physical, and mental, sports, but that’s where the main similarities end and differences begin.

        <p>
          What makes tennis such a unique sport is the development of tennis etiquette over the years the sport has been played. It's just as important to players as it is to spectators and parents. Although following these unspoken rules may sound old-fashioned, they are the best way to ensure everyone enjoys the game thoroughly.

        <p>
          Serving in tennis is one of the hardest parts of the game, but staying motivated to improve it, can make it one of the most rewarding advantages over your opponent. It is the only shot where you possess all the power, in terms of its timing and execution, since all other shots are reactive and dependent on your opponent. There are four main types of serves: the flat serve, slice serve, kick serve, and underhand serve.

          Hey there! We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting different parts of the country differently - in some states, it may be possible to return to playing tennis safely, especially with court facilities slowly opening up. By following the guidelines released by the federal government, as well as specific rules of local governments and health agencies, facilities and players can make informed decisions as to whether their tennis activities can resume.</p>

			    Hi! Today, we wanted to share the key differences between playing singles and doubles in tennis and some strategies to use when playing doubles. Essentially, the rules for doubles are the same as singles, except the court boundaries are wider. A tennis court has two lines on the left and right side running from the baseline to the net.
